# GraphQL, TypeScript, Nextjs, Prisma, Nexus Scehma boilerplate

A boilerplate references code to start a project with Apollo GraphQL, Next.js, Nexus schema and TypeScript, using a code-first approach.

Contains Temporary models in prisma schema.

## To get started:

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h4L/GraphQL-TypeScript-prisma-Nextjs-Nexus-boilerplate-2 && cd GraphQL-TypeScript-prisma-Nextjs-Nexus-boilerplate-2
```

- Install needed dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

- (Optional) Add values to the DB

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

- Create a file called `.env` in the root and fill in needed values taking `.env.example` as reference.

- Start the development server and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site. Also, visit the GraphQL playground at [/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql) in development mode.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Well, that's about it. You should be up and running with a minimal GraphQL client and server in Next.js!!
